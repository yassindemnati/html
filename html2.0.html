    <h1>Lazar Vachter, better known as Django, is a French rapper from Paris. Formerly Django DKZ or Apoklips, the artist has gone through different phases during his career</h1>
    <p>It was in 2016 that Django managed to catch the eye (and ears) of Internet users thanks to his piece Fichu which allowed him to accumulate a hell of a buzz. Very quickly, he knows how to satisfy a certain audience thanks to his references to Dragonball Z or even Mentalist. Unfortunately, it also earned him a lot of criticism. Indeed, many have criticized him for his resemblance, both physical and in his pen, with… Nekfeu. Moreover, Deen Burbigo had not hesitated to give his own opinion on this point and had declared on this subject: “For me honestly there is no debate, it is undeniable. The influence is there, and it has not been digested yet. […] There the fact that there is the Internet the guy was immediately successful, and honestly it looks a lot, a lot like Nekfeu and even there are two or three things in it. But suddenly there is an audience that is there right away, and it is good. For me, he is a young man who is talented but who has not yet digested his influences. An Alpha or a Ken we already said a little Dany Dan, so that will not prevent him from becoming someone but on the other hand he has to stop the plagiarism a little. Because there for example his latest logo, I can show it to you right away, it's the logo of Sango, a friend of ours, that he pumped from A to Z. So Django, if you listen to us, you you have talent but you will have to start to stand out. […] We must stop the plagiarism”</p>
<h2>Back a few months later with Impala 1967 which moves away from its flow of the previous title. Django returns to the source by unveiling Birds. The clip is in turn criticized because of the gestures which would look a lot like that of SCH but also at the level of the universe of the video and the look.</h2>
